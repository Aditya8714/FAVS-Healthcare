Introduction:
In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital world, traditional methods of healthcare appointment management have become inefficient and time-consuming. To address this, the team developed a web-based Doctor Appointment System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
The platform allows patients to easily schedule consultations and doctors to manage their availability efficiently.

Problem Statement:
Difficulty in managing manual doctor appointments and patient records.

Lack of real-time doctor availability status.

Inefficient communication between doctors and patients.

No centralized system for maintaining patient history and appointment logs.

Need for a secure, user-friendly platform with role-based access (admin, doctor, patient).

Requirement to streamline appointment scheduling, updates, and cancellations.

Proposed System & Features:
A web-based Doctor Appointment Management System enabling:

User Authentication & Role Management

Doctor Profile Management

Appointment Booking System

Dashboard Interface for doctors, patients, and admins

Patient Medical History Maintenance

Admin Control Panel

Responsive Design for different devices

Technologies Used:
